# Learning trunk-based development with puppies

This is a repository for learning to deal with typical situations when
collaborating on a code base. Our example is a web site for showing
picators of puppies. You work on this website with your friends, but
sometimes you make changes independently from each other and need to use
Git commands to reconcile the changes.


TODO

- Prerequisites (Git, some command line experience, command line editor).
- Introductory explanation (merges (with `--no-ff` to simulate pull requests), what are "pull requests" (moderated
	merges), `git log`, `git branch` for listing branches; we don't teach
	how to commit in this tutorial)
- Explain how to reset
- Explain how to start a lesson
