# Ideas for the future

Things that are out of scope for now, but sound like good ideas

- automated "success" checker (analyses the structure of the commits in
	the `main` branch for each lesson, sees if it looks right)
- Interactive text or web UI that presents the lesson texts and can maybe
	trigger the lesson preparation scripts.
- Refactor setup scripts into a shared script, rely more on convention for
	setting up lessons -> better maintenance of scripts and easier to add
	new lessons
