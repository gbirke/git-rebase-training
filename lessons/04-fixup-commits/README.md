# Fixing older commits

Alicia has worked on making the site mobile-ready! She used background
colors to tell the different content boxes apart and then forgot the
remove them. She has also committed another improvement to the footer.

Your tasks: before merging the branch, remove the background color, but
make the history look as if the background color was never there.
